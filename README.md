Prior to using the app, ket's quickly review some fundamental baseball rules...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-There are 9 innings in a game
-Each inning is comprised of a "top half" and a "bottom half"
-The home team gets to pitch in the top half and the away team gets to hit. (vice-verse for the bottom half)
-In each inning a batter has an "at-bat", attempting to score runs
-As each hitter either reaches base, or is retired, the next hitter in the batting order is called up for an at-bat
-This is repeated until 3 outs are recorded
-The team with the largest score at the end of 9 innings is declared the winner
